    <p class='green'>ABOUT OUR BREWERY</p>
    <p>For thousands of years beer has had a place in society. Some might argue that it's even responsible for organized civilization. Even though such a commodity had been around for so long, there is a huge opening in our market to be innovative and creative. Breweries new and old have continued to push the boundaries of beer making. We at Cosmos plan to be on the forefront of brewing greatness. From old world styles to modern techniques, our philosophy is simply universal. We have surrounded ourselves with local and international inspirations and continue to develop our craft. This is directly reflected in our line of artisanal and aged beers. As we count down to launching a power house micro brewery that will be seen across the cosmos, we invite you to hop aboard and be a part of our travels into the future. Learn from the past, be present, drink forward and remember...<span class='green'>SAVE SPACE FOR BEER!</span></p>
