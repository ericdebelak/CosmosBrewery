    <p>Found on Kepler-186f, HABITABLE SAIZON forms at the base of Yakima Falls where water gives way to life. Various cherry varieties vitalize this land locked liquid that packs a pucker punch. Soaking local oaks add classic toasty tones. The red dwarf sun radiates through with a pink hue, while busybodied Brettanomytes fight for palate supremacy. The universe is wild! <span class='red'>SAVE SPACE FOR BEER!</span></p>
